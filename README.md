## Purpose for using Redux - Coming soon!
As you can see in the commit history. I first wrote/learned how to deal with state changes without the help of a state management library.
Although I understand using Redux in a project this size is way over kill. I wanted to teach myself how to use Redux and learn the benefits of using such a library.
